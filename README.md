Creating a portfolio site using CMS software Wordpress

Here is a brief explanation and guide for installation of wordpress<br>

1/Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven’t already.<br>
2/Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a MySQL (or MariaDB) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.<br>
3/(Optional) Find and rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, then edit the file (see Editing wp-config.php) and add your database information.<br>
Note: If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional and you can skip it as the install program will create the wp-config.php file for you.

4/Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:
    *If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. http://example.com/), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPressdirectory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.<br>
    *If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your website (e.g. http://example.com/blog/), create the blog directory on your             server and upload the contents of the unzipped WordPress package to the directory via FTP.<br>
    *Note: If your FTP client has an option to convert file names to lower case, make sure it’s disabled.<br>
5/Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.
            *If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: http://example.com/<br>
            *If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: http://example.com/blog/<br>
           <h3> That’s it! WordPress should now be installed.</h3><br>
